It seems that there are some new trades on Bittrex that the bot is not aware
of previously, so it needs to refresh its trades database from Bittrex, but it
can't find a `bittrex-fullOrders.csv' file in the docker/config directory.

This file needs to be placed next to config.ini, and its name is case sensitive.
Please download this file from Bittrex and place it in the docker/config
directory and place Enter when ready.

This file can be downloaded after logging in to your account from the following
address by pressing the "Load All" button and then pressing Submit.
