It seems that there are some new trades on Poloniex that the bot is not aware
of previously, so it needs to refresh its trades database from Poloniex, but it
can't find a `poloniex-tradeHistory.csv' file in the installation directory.

This file needs to be placed next to config.ini, and its name is case sensitive.
Please download this file from Poloniex and place it in the installation
directory and place Enter when ready.
